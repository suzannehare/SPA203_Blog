This is the first post for hypraptive. Hypraptive is a vessel for a group of developers to get together and work on interesting projects and applications. Most of our projects are related to multimedia, connected devices (IoT) and deep learning.

This site makes use of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We decided to go down this path after reading Andrej Karpathy's blog [Switching Blog from Wordpress to Jekyll](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/).
